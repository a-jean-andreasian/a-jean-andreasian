# About me for recruiters: 

## 1. Vision
- **I love:** building products that bring real value or satisfaction to people. The kind of products whose ads simply show what they do and what features they have.
- **I don‚Äôt accept:** fraud, scam, or bubble domains.
- **I don‚Äôt accept teams:** with toxicity. I do respect everyone with the same respect as the CEO and want to work in a team with the same mindset.

 ## 2. Background
- **Education:** InfoSec, Faculty of Computer Engineering.
     - Applied: InfoSec Theory, Cryptography, Secure Software Development, Network Security & Web Security, Malware Analysis, Reverse Engineering, Organizational Aspects of InfoSec, Programming.

- **Experience intro:**
     - Initially I've been working in cybersec, then by the time I needed new experience and knowlegde so I came to software development.
     - Tried almost all domains, but the most I liked and picked backend and system development.

 - **Experience:**
      - I've been lucky to join a team which was insourcing projects and products by big players, so my code is stil there in products of Skyscanner, AT&T.
      - Also I been a per project contractor with Yandex.
      - Now I do have my ongoing contribution in LG until December 2025.
      - Besides big players, I do also have experience with IT consulting brands such as ELEKS and Interexy. 

- **Enterprice:**
     - Dependeing on the project developed from scratch and supported the full circle, maintened, supported, or implemented the tasks with close cooperation with product, devops, frontend, analitics.
     - I was and am always okay to pick the most challanging task, and even to write in another language for the first time. It's cool to me because I'm open to learn, because I like thing and want to know as much as possible.
     - I reject the mindset of other seniors who refuse to learn, stopped in progress and sublimating this by other irrelevant things like minding others' business, and becoming more and more toxic = literally unpleasant and boring person.
 
 
- **Type of enterprice projects:**
     - Entertaiment domain: Blockchain-based ecosystem for content creators (blockchain is about the payment option), booking sytem, recommendation system.
     - Internal domain: Payment system, management system, tools for sales and analitical departments (not just pipelines, because pipelines I've also built), AI integration tools, as well as projects related to NLP, CV and OCR.


## 3. Info
- More interested: in non-IT product companies.
- For remote positions sometimes I prefer companies that pay in stablecoins and/or weekly.
- Contract preferences: 6 / 12 / 18 months.
- Full-time depends on your team and management.
- Currently employed. Current contract ends in December 2025.
